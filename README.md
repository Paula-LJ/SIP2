SIP2

This folder contains all the folders of the project from the second practice of Interactive Sistems. 

The changes I added are: 
- The music 
- The hearts above the sheeps with animation 
- The animations of the sheeps when they are hitted by the hay 
- The counter of sheeps falling, this counter has an error and it counts two instead of 1 each time a sheep falls, 
  so I changed the maximum number of fallen sheeps to 6 in order to have the same oportunities. 
- The counter of sheeps hitted 
- That this counter appears in the screen 
- A menu screen
- An executable of the game
